He was based in London and was in the front line for air attacks (he slept through most of them) but he had a very useful attribute. He seemed to know when a flying bomb was going to fall near his home. 

When he took cover, everyone around knew they should do the same. Weighing in at nearly 14 pounds (over 6 kilos), he was a very large fawn-and-brown tabby with spotless white front, tummy and 'socks' and an inverted 'V for victory' on his nose.
