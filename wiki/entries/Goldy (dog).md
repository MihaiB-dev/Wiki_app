Goldy is my precious (little brother) dog. I love him soo much and he helps me in any situation. He is a good listener and a bit lazy. When it comes to going out with him, it's a whole other dog: active, jumping around, and just living his life to the fullest.

Also, if *you want to meet him*, speak with his brother and he will reach out any time soon.
