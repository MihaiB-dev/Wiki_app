A born and raised ship cat, served a few Royal Navy aircraft carriers, but served with the HMS Victorious in the early 1940s as the official Captainâ€™s Cat. It can be assumed that he performed his duties ably, since he traveled over 30,000 miles during his naval service. He may also be one of the reasons for why the black cat is considered lucky in Great Britain.
